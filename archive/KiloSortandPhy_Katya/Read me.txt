Step 1. Organize data into the expected format: mat file

Step 2. Run KiloSort_Batch_Process.
Indicate electrodes that don't have spikes in exclude_electrodes as a vector

Step 3. Cultivate data in phy from all animals.

%Critically important:
It is safest to make sure that every cluster is manually marked as good, MUA, or noise, even if kilosort already marked them appropriately.
Rarely, phy can get confused and loses the labels, and if a cell is unlabeled, it will confuse the matlab scripts.

Step 4. Run PostPhy_Batch_Process.
Indicate electrodes that don't have spikes in exclude_electrodes as a vector
This will output a matrix "data."

Step 5. Save data to a .mat file for safe keeping.

Step 6. Now your data analysis can begin!
